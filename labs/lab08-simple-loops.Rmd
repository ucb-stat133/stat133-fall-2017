## Introduction

The majority of functions that work with vectors are vectorized.
Remember that vectorized operations are calculations that are applied 
to all the elements in a vector (element-wise operations).

In order to learn about loops and iterations, it's good to forget about 
vectorized operations in R. This means that you will be asked to write code, 
using some sort of loop structure, to perform tasks for which there is 
already a vectorized implementation. For example, in this lab you will have 
to write code with various types of loops to calculate the mean of a numeric
vector. This can easily be done using the function `mean()`. But we don't
want you to use `mean()`. We want you to think about control-flow structures,
which are essential in any programming activity.


## For loops

Let's start with a super simple example. Consider a vector `vec <- c(3, 1, 4)`. 
And suppose you want to add 1 to every element of `vec`. You know that this
can easily be achieved using vectorized code:

```{r}
vec <- c(3, 1, 4) 

vec + 1
```

In order to learn about loops, I'm going to ask you to forget about the notion
of vectorized code in R. That is, pretend that R does not have vectorized functions. 

Think about what you would manually need to do in order to add 1 to the elements 
in `vec`. This addition would involve taking the first element in `vec` and 
add 1, then taking the second element in `vec` and add 1, and finally the third
element in `vec` and add 1, something like this: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
vec[1] + 1
vec[2] + 1
vec[3] + 1
```

The code above does the job. From a purely arithmetic standpoint, the three 
lines of code reflect the operation that you would need to carry out to add 
1 to all the elements in `vec`.

From a programming point of view, you are performing the same type of operation
three times: selecting an element in `vec` and adding 1 to it. But there's
a lot of (unnecessary) repetition.

This is where loops come very handy. Here's how to use a `for ()` loop
to add 1 to each element in `vec`: 

```{r}
vec <- c(3, 1, 4)

for (j in 1:3) {
  print(vec[j] + 1)
}
```

In the code above we are taking each `vec` element `vec[j]`, adding 1 to it, 
and printing the outcome with `print()` so you can visualize the additions
at each iteration of the loop.

__Your turn__: rewrite the `for` loop in order to triple every element in `vec`,
and printing the output at each step of the loop:

```{r}
vec <- c(3, 1, 4) # Change this value!

for (j in c()) { # Replace c() with an appropriate sequence.
  # Fill in.
  
}
```

What if you want to create a vector `vec2`, in which you store the values 
produced at each iteration of the loop? Here's one possibility:

```{r}
vec <- c(3, 1, 4)  # Change this value!
vec2 <- rep(0, length(vec))  # "empty" of zeros vector to be filled in the loop

for (i in c()) {# Replace c() with an appropriate sequence.
  # Fill in.
}
```

## Summation Series

Write a for loop to compute the following two series. Your loop should start at step $k=0$ and stop at step $n$. Test your code with
different values for $n$. And store each k-th term at each iteration.
Does the series converge as $n$ increase?

![series1](lab08-images/sum_series1.png)

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{2^k} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \dots + \frac{1}{2^n}
$$


![series2](lab08-images/sum_series2.png)

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{1}{9^k} =1 + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{81} + \dots + \frac{1}{9^n}
$$


### Arithmetic Series

Write a for loop to compute the following arithmetic series $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$ when $a_1 = 3$, and $d = 3$. For instance: $3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + \dots$.

![arithmetic series](lab08-images/arith_series.png)

$$
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
$$

 
Test your code with different values for $n$. And store each n-th term at each iteration.
Does the series converge as $n$ increase?


### Geometric Sequence

A sequence such as $3, 6, 12, 24, 48$ is an example of a geometric sequence. 
In this type of sequence, the $n$-th term is obtained as: 

![geometric sequence](lab08-images/geo_seq.png)

$$
a_n = a_1 \times r^{n-1}
$$

where: $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of 
terms.

Write a for loop to compute the sum of the first $n$ terms of:
$3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + \dots$. 
Test your code with different values for $n$. Does the series converge as $n$ 
increase?

## Sine Approximation

Consider the following series that is used to approximate the function $sin(x)$:

![sine approximation](lab08-images/sine_series.png)

$$
sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!} + \dots
$$

Write a `for` loop  to approximate $sin(x)$. Try different number of terms, 
$n = 5, 10, 50, 100$. Compare your loop with the `sin()` function.

```{r}
# Your for loop

```

-----

## For loop with a matrix

Consider the following matrix `A`:

```{r}
A <- matrix(1:20, nrow = 5, ncol = 4)
A
```

Say we want to add 1 to all elements in row 1, add 2 to all elements in 
row 2, add 3 to all elements in row 3, and so on. To do this without using
vectorized coe, you need to work with two `for()` loops. One loop will control
how you traverse the matrix by rows, the other loop will control how you 
traverse the matrix by columns. Here's how:

```{r}
# empty matrix B
B <- matrix(NA, nrow = 5, ncol = 4)

# for loop to get matrix B
for (i in 1:nrow(A)) {
  for (j in 1:ncol(A)) {
    B[i,j] <- A[i,j] + i
  }
}

B
```


### Your turn

Consider the following matrix `X`:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
X <- matrix(rnorm(12), nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
X
```

Write code in R, using loops, to get a matrix `Y` such that the negative 
numbers in `A` are transformed into squared values, while the positive 
numbers in `A` are transformed into square root values

```{r}
# for loops to get Y

```

## Dividing a number by 2 multiple times

The following examples involve dividing a number by 2 until it becomes odd.

### Using a `repeat` loop

```{r}
# Divide a number by 2 until it becomes odd.
val_rep <- 898128000 # Change this value!

repeat {
  print(val_rep)
  if (val_rep %% 2 == 1) { # If val_rep is odd,
    break                  # end the loop.
  }
  val_rep <- val_rep / 2 # Divide val_rep by 2 since val_rep was even.
  # When the end of the loop is reached, return to the beginning of the loop.
}
```


### Using a `while` Loop


```{r}
# Divide a number by 2 until it becomes odd.
val_while <- 898128000 # Change this value!

while (val_while %% 2 == 0) { # Continue the loop as long as val_while is even.
  print(val_while)
  val_while <- val_while / 2
}
print(val_while)
```


## Make a `reduce()` function

Now generalize the above code to create a function `reduce()` which performs
the same operation. (You should change very little.)

```{r eval = FALSE}
# your reduce() function
reduce <- function(x) {
  # Fill in.
  
}

reduce(898128000)
```

## Average

The average of $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is given by the following 
formula:

![arithmetic mean](lab08-images/arith_mean.png)

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n}{n}
$$

Write R code, using each type of loop (e.g. `for`, `while`, `repeat`) to 
implement the arithmetic mean of the vector `x = 1:100`


## Standard Deviation

The sample standard deviation of a list of $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ 
is given by the following formula:

![standard deviation](lab08-images/std_dev.png)

$$
SD = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 }
$$

Write R code, using each type of loop (e.g. `for`, `while`, `repeat`) to 
implement the sample standard deviation of the vector `x = 1:100`


## Geometric Mean

The geometric mean of $n$ numbers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is given by the 
following formula:

![geometric mean](lab08-images/geom_mean.png)

$$
\bar{x} = \left ( \prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i \right )^{1/n}
$$

Write R code, using each type of loop (e.g. `for`, `while`, `repeat`) to 
implement the geometric mean of the vector `x = 1:50`
